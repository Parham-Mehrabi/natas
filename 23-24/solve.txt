since im not a PHP developer this one tricked me really hard,
when i was checking the condition on my machine it always return true
my problem was the part that compare a string to a number,
in my machine php 8.2.7 is installed (the last version for debian 12 stable),
and i tried anything and it always returned me true,
since i asked chatgpt(free version for before 2021 world), about how PHP compare,
and apparently it handle string vs integer compression like this:
"if there is a number in the beginning of the string count the string as the number",
 which make it clear how to solve the level but my question is still on the table
but obviously it wasnt work like that on my machine so i used online interpreter and still had the problem,
but on this site: https://onlinephp.io/
i was able to change the php and i realized the change it on version 8
when you test it on 7.4.32 it deal with it just as chatgpt described,
anyway this site is old and apparently they didn't update their PHP,

you just need to add a number higher than 10 in the beginning of the string like this 99iloveyou, thats all
