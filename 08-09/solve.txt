in this level it encode our input and compare it with a string, which looks like a encoded string,

the problem is the encodedSecret function here is not a proper hash function (like sha256),
so we can do the reverse and find out which string will return encoded secret
we can do it with almost any language and even online convertors however PHP has handy methods for this one, but ill solve it with python anyway
