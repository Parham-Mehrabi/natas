in this level we are facing strcmp function in PHP,
this function compare an string to another one character by character based on ASCII table until it find a difference,
so for example if first character be A(which is 65 in ascii table) and the other one be B(which is 66 in ascii table), its stop there and return -1,
so according to this source code we need to put an string that when it compare it to the censored string, it returns 0 until the last character,
which means brute forcing the whole thing,
however its clearly is not an easy task so we just need to send something else than a string so the function crashes and we get into the if block,
we can send an array using burpsuit or just use my python script which do the same,
keep it in mind if you want to send an array using GET params, u need to specify the parameter name with an [] so that means its not a string but an array
like this => http://url?passwd[]=[my, array, or, even, not, an, array]
