when you inspect this page there is 1pixel image with this source => 'files/pixel.ong'

if you check "directory listing" or "directory traversal" vulnerability, its a webserver miss-configuration,
you can access the directories by deleting file name in URL, http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/


however if we hasnt a clue like the pixel.png here, we could use skipfish in kali like:
skipfish -o ./my_dir -A username:password url
where my_dir is a empty dir and username and password is authentication for this page and url is the url of this page,
which is http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ and it find all the things itself
