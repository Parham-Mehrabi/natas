one of the easiest, i solve it in first try, apparently it reveal the password when you have revelio in your GET parameters,
and if you are not admin it will redirect you before you can see the password,
there is more than 2345678987654323456789 ways to solve this level but i used python3,
just request the page and don't let redirect with allow_redirects=False
