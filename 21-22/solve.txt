this one is the most unreal one yet, the first page dont have something for us just tell us "this website is colocated with . . ."
in the second page at first i though we should try to some inject in inputs but the problem was in the first function,
it check if submit is exist in the GET parameters, it store all the get params to session (using foreach),
so we simply need to delete our session cookie in the second page, then add ?submit=something&admin=1 after our url in browser,
then refresh the page and copy the new session cookie, then go back to first page and replace the old cookie with the one you copied,
refresh the page and you have admin credentials,
you can do it using burpsuit or script too but its unnecessary, how ever ill provide the code
