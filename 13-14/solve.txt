just like previous level but this time check the file signature as a validation,
you can change the signature to 'FF D8 FF EE' which is jpg signature using many methods

the easiest way to do it is to use ghex tool to edit the first bytes and check it with 
xdd ./your_file | head
but if you are not in linux and dont have these tools you can use my python script which will do the same
how ever modified_file already have the signature and you can compare it with upload.php using 
exiftool or file command
