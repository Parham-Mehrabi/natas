my php knowledge is too limited and i have no clue how to solve this level

but apparently there is a vulnerability in php serialize and the  __destruct method in classes,
im not interested in PHP but if you want to know about this level more,
check :
https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection
which is PHP object injection on owasp

since its too much PHP i wont try to solve rest of it for now
