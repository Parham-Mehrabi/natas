# SOLVING NATAS
i'll try to solve natas chalanges on this project

#### apparently passwords change over time so do not count on password.txt and use the solutions 

### almost all solutions require previous level password and then passwords are getting change either replace the password for basic authentication or use your own login header 

for example in level 10-11 i used authentication header and on   
level 24-25 i used basic authentication

for basic authentications you just need to replace the password and it will put the proper header automatically,
while for levels like 10-11 you should either put a proper header or use other methods for authentication
