the technic we are going to use here called SQL-injection,
according to source code this level will put our input directly in a sql query without any validation.
so we can easily put our selves query and comment the reset of the line 

to achieve that you can leave the password blank(doesnt matter since its going to be commented) and put this injection to username field:
" OR 2>1; #

this injection first close the " which is for username then it add an 'OR' which will fix the condition if have something true next to it then we say 2>1,
which is clearly true so it will select all users, in the end we finish our query with ; and comment the rest line with #
