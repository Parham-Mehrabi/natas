this one is a little complicated,
the whole idea is using XOR encryption, XOR uses bits to encrypt data,
it need a input, a key and will give you an output, its work like it:
compare 2 bits, if equal return 0 else return 1,
for example in python you can xor with '^' symbol following XORs return these results :

1 ^ 1 -> 0
1 ^ 0 -> 1
1 ^ 2 -> 3      (1 binary is 01, 2 binary is 10 so it compare and return 11 which is 3 in binary)

but the point is if you XOR the result with either of them it will return the other one:

3 ^ 1 -> 2 (binary: 11 xor 01 -> 10)
3 ^ 2 -> 1 (binary: 11 xor 10 -> 01)

in other word if we have the result of xor and its raw data we can find the key ! ! !

here in this level our Cookie(data) is the result, and the default_data is the raw data XORed in the function when we don't change bg,
so we can find the censored key in the function (check the source) and then xor our data with it and put in our cookies,

basically we need to xor ( "showpassword"=>"no", "bgcolor"=>"#ffffff") this data with the censored key and replace it with our old Cookie

since im going to use their own function for XOR and other PHP handy methods for this kind of stuff, ill solve this one using PHP
