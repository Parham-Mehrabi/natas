# http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/

when we click about and home page, in URLs we can see a query that looks like its accessing files on the server,
and if you scan the URL with skipfish, skipfish will find the server's /etc/hosts and /etc/passwd,
in other hand in the page HTMLs they hint us by telling that they keep levels passwords in /etc/natas_webpass

so we should try to access that with this url:
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8

we can catch it with both relative and absolute paths
