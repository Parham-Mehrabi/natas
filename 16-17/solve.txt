in this one they improve the validation and we cant use awk anymore and they put our input inside quotes so we cant add more tags(flags) using dashes '-',
but we can still use $ and (),
previously we check if we get something(since we would return e), but now we kinda do the reverse here,
we grep with regex in password file like ^tmp_pass and if the inner grep match with the password it will return the whole line,
in that case the outer grep wont match any line in the dictionary so we get nothing and we can add ^tmp_pass to the beginning of our found password
if you just want to use the script file remember to either update the auth credentials
