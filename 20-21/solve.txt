if you intruder attack this page with burp suit,
you will realize the response would have an error when you send 0A which is equal to new line in ascii table,
and apparently(i wasn't able to figure it out but search it through the web and youtube), the read function here,
split the input from -1 index when the write use the first line,
in this case we can send the input which create a random and then read admin session,
in burp you can use test "%0A admin 1" in python you can use \n instead and repeat the request with previous session,
which is admin session
