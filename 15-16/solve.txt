in this level the page just let us know if query returned something or not and we can use it to brute force the password using LIKE command in sql,
and we also use BINARY to make the query case sensitive, the % in SQL's LIKE is like the rest of the value,
in other words 
LIKE BINARY "A%" 
means the value start with the letter A
