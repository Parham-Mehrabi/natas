this one is super fun there is a ton of ways to solve this one but ill do the easiest one:

just inspect the page and rename the file to .php and instead of an image upload your php file,
in your php file you can do lots of things for example echo the password of natas13 but im going to use
one of PHP methods called passthru (that we saw in level 10 and level 11 for grep)
and create a online terminal for myself

to sum up:
1. inspect the page and change the hard coded .jpg to .php in the hidden input (input name is 'filename')
2. either upload my php file or create yourown and upload that
3.use the link to execute the command that show you the password


instead of changing the hardcoded .jpg you can proxy the request with burpsuit and modify the file extension there since this level handle the name on client side
