this one was the hardest one so far,

the problem of this source is where it delete ../ manually in the source code,
imagine a site has a mechanism like this to prevent XSS,
and they remove <script> like how this level deletes ../
the only thing you should do is instead of using
<script>,
use <scr<script>ipt>
then after deleting <script> from it, we create a new <script>,
here they delete ../
so we can modify our path like this:
../etc => ..././etc then after deleting the ../, we have a new ../,
because the function is not recursive and it dont replace it with something and just delete illigal part,
so to access our desired directory we need to use ....// instead of ../,
it doesnt matter if you use ....// or ..././ or something like that,
as long as there is one ../ in it and after removing ../ you have a new ../,
it will work.

however when we gonna access /etc/natas_webpass/ it dont remove the illigal part,
the function dont return anything in that case, so we cant use it to access natas_webpass directly,

the other clue we have is their log directory which is in ../log,
we can access that with ....//trick with this url:
http://natas25.natas.labs.overthewire.org?lang=....//logs/natas25_{"PHPSESSID"}.log
where you should replace {"PHPSESID"} with your phpsesid,
but accessing logs is not enough ! ! !

the other problem this page has is when its logging,
its use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] without any validation and put it in the logs,
later we can use our trick to load the log file in PHP,
so we should modify our User-Agent header and write some php to run there

in other word we should do this:
1. make a request that will logged
2. in that request modify our User-Agent
3. read the logs


for the first step we just need to use ....// trick since its a directory traversal attempt(since its include ../),
it will log it for use

then we should modify this request header with our PHP code,
we can either use burp suit or python

then in our header for User-Agent we put our PHP code:
{'User-Agent': '<?php passthru("cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas26"); ?>'}
in this piece of code i used passthru that we used in previous levels,
its run a os command then print the output

then  we need to check the logs and see the natas26 password instead of our userAgent in logs


i did all these steps in my python script, however you can use burp for this level,
i didnt use python to figure it out either
