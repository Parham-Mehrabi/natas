checking refs is not a common practice in securing our web app but here we are facing it,
to access this url from that url u just need to go to natas5 and after skiping the basic authentication,
then inspect the 403 page(unauthoraized), and add a anchor tag (a tag) to HTML with href to previous level like this:

 <a href="http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"> Go to natas4</a>
