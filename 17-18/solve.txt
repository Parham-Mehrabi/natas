in this level they comment the outputs so basically we have to do a "Blind SQL Injection" which is kinda cool,
since we have no idea if our query works or not we can add another and and check if it works,
to do that we use sleep(), then we measure the response time, since my net is too bad i do another check to make sure
the delay is sleep()'s fault not my internet's, but if you sure about your internet you can remove the double check part
