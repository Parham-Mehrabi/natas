just like previous one but this time they trying to encrypt the session,
however there is no view-source but if you go to http://natas19.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index-source.html
you can still check the source,
the encode method used in source is called 'Ascii-hex' in python its simple hex(ord('value_string'))
for example for number 625 we have:
hex(ord('6')) + hex(ord('2')) + hex(ord('5')), which is:
'0x36' + '0x32' + '0x35' and the output would be 363235
i wrote a function which do exactly same thing as they have the same in their source,
just did the same thing as previous level and password poped up
